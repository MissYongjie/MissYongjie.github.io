Yongjie Zheng is currently a Ph.D. student at [Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSLab)](https://rslab.disi.unitn.it/), University of Trento, advised by  [Prof. Lorenzo Bruzzone](https://rslab.disi.unitn.it/people/#LorenzoBruzzone). She was also an academic visitor of Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. Her current research is focusing on AI for Earth and planetary surface mapping.

My research interests:
<ul>
  <li>🌍 Remote Sensing, Information Fusion, Artificial Intelligence</li>
  <li>🛰️ Earth Surface Observation, Deep Space Mapping, Planetary Exploration</li>
  <li>📡 Large-scale mapping and detection of Earth and other planets (Lunar, Mars, Asteroid Bennu)</li>
</ul>

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** in 2021, under the expert guidance of [Prof. Nong Sang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ky_ZowEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Changxin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4tku-lwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My academic journey was further enriched by a visiting Ph.D. position at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, **University of Adelaide**, where I worked closely with [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ljk2BvIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). During my doctoral studies, I received the **Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award** (one of only 10 students in the country).

My industry experience includes being a research intern at **Microsoft Research Asia** and **Megvii (Face++)**, where I collaborated with [Dr. Jingdong Wang](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/), [Dr. Gang Yu](https://www.skicyyu.org/), and [Dr. Jian Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALVSZAYAAAAJ&hl=en). I was part of the winning team at the COCO & Mapillary Panoptic Segmentation Challenge 2018.

My passion lies in tackling complex problems in computer vision and artificial intelligence. I have made significant contributions to the fields of semantic/panoptic segmentation, behavior prediction, and vision-language models. Among my most notable works are:
- [BiSeNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Changqian_Yu_BiSeNet_Bilateral_Segmentation_ECCV_2018_paper.html) (Rank 10 in ECCV 2018 Top-10 Influential Papers & Citation > 2500).
- [BiSeNetV2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-021-01515-2) (IJCV & ESI & ESI-Hot & Citation > 1000).
- [DFNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Yu_Learning_a_Discriminative_CVPR_2018_paper.html) (CVPR & Citation > 900)
- [Lite-HRNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Yu_Lite-HRNet_A_Lightweight_High-Resolution_Network_CVPR_2021_paper.html) (CVPR & Citation > 300)
